# Creating a Base Project

## The HTML file serves as the 'index' for the project. It is what the rest of the files are linked to. This file also dictates the content of the webpage and how the webpage is structured. 

## The Javascript file runs a simple command that prints a string to the developer console. This file could be used to build additional functionality into the webpage.

## The CSS file contains all of the styling for the HTML page (fonts, sizing, colors etc).
